  # specify the maximum depth that blocks can be nested (off by default)

  # Forbid the import of external modules that are not declared in the
  # package.json's dependencies, devDependencies, optionalDependencies or
  # peerDependencies
  # (note: we disable this rule because packages inside `src` behave like
  # aliases: e.g.: require('elements/foo') works).
